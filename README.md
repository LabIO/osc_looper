osc_looper
==========

osc_looper: patch to use the micklooper on a pc controlled by the touchOSC (layout "Beatmachine") of the android, and others.
This is a looper that records on three layers. The first one is the one that determines the length of the loop the others
are recorded on top of it. All can be muted and played again. Effects can be applied controlled by the accelerometer of the android.
